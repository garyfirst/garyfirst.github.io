                <p>With the rapid development of information technology, educational technology has almost become indispensible for language and translation learning ranging from traditional multimedia tools to modern VR and MR equipment. Educational technology is the use of both physical hardware and educational theoretics. It encompasses several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online learning, and where mobile technologies are used, m-learning. Both theory and application researches are important for language and translation proficiency improvement of various learners. Therefore, this workshop aims at serving as a meeting point for researchers, educationist and practitioners to discuss state-of-the-art and in-progress researches, exchange ideas and share experiences about educational technology for language and translation learning from the perspectives of both theory and application. We hope that the implications of findings of each work presented in this workshop can be used to improve the development of language and translation educational environments.</p>

              <p><strong>Paper  Reviewing and Selection Process</strong></p>
                <p><br>
                Each paper will be reviewed by at least two reviewers from the workshop chairs and program committee members. Reviewers are selected based on their familiarity with the topics. Necessary procedures are to be carried out to avoid potential conflicts of interests during the review process, and review reports from the reviewers will be returned to the authors anonymously. In unusual cases, such as when an external reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, PC chairs will invite other reviewers who have sufficient expertise but are not among the program committee members. In those cases, at least two PC chairs will examine the review comments to ensure the quality of the review. Accepted papers will be selected based on the mean scores given by reviewers.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As part of the International Symposium on Emerging Technologies for Education (SETE) 2024, all accepted papers of this workshop will be included in the SETE Proceedings, which will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). LNCS volumes are indexed in the ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Scopus, EI Compendex, DBLP, etc.</p>
